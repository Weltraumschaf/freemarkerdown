# FreeMarkerDown

This   library  is   simply  a   combination  of   [Freemarker][freemarker]  and
[PegDown][pegdown]. The  use case  is: You  want to  render [Markdown][markdowm]
but you  also want to  have the  features from a  template engine. Yes,  you can
combine such two  libraries to do that.  Or you can save time  because I've done
that for you: Here is FreeMarkerDown.
